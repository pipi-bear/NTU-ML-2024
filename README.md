This repository contains the homework of the course "Machine Learning" @ NTU CSIE (2024 FALL), conducted by prof. Hsuan Tien Lin.

You are free to use all the contents to help you finish your homework and aid your learning, 
however, note that there are many mistakes, so I would really recommend you reading the following "IMPORTANT" part 
to ensure that you won't misuse the wrong contents. 

# IMPORTANT: Errors in my answer & how to check them

In each of the homework directory, I added two markdown files:

1. `hw*_choices.md`
2. `hw*_grade.md`

The first file contains the choices of mine for the first 4 multiple choices questions in the homework, and the wrong choices are marked.

The second file contains the grades for each human-graded questions, if I got comments for the reason why points are deducted, 
I'll mention below the corresponding question. (However, I did not get comments for most of the questions.)

Albeit I think most of the file titles are clear enough, I'll put some desciptions about how to find what you need below.

# File titles

The original questions file are named as `hw*.pdf`.
> Note that some have red corrections, so if there's something like `hw*_red.pdf`, you should use this one instead of `hw*.pdf`.

At first, I wrote my solutions for the human-graded questions on Goodnotes and export them, so the solutions for each question are pdf files with names `q*.pdf` or something like that. The final file that I hand in combined all of these solutions, and they're saved in a file named as `HW*_final_answers.pdf`, `total answer.pdf` or something alike.

For homework 6, I started to use markdown to write my solutions, so you can find both `.md` and `.pdf` files for the same question. 

For homework 7, I changed to use latex to write my solutions, so there's many files with type `.aux`, `.aug`..., just ignore them and choose from 
using the `.pdf` or `.tex` file.

# Coding questions

I'm really not that good at coding, so for the coding problems, I really recommend you to check the points I got before using them.

For some of the coding questions, I modified multiple times, so there would probably contain multiple files with names like `10_v2.py`, `10_v3.py`..., the one that I used to put in the report and hand in would be the last one (check the largest number after `v` since it stands for "version".)

# Reporting errors

If you found any error or anything confusing, feel free to report it in issues, send me an email or leave a comment in my hackmd page :)

You can find my email and hackmd info. in my github personal page.

# Additional information

Before I took this course, I chose some materials related to machine learning to study, and made some notes (in Mandarin) in the following hackmd page (you can open it in book mode for better readability):

I tried my best to explain everything without omitting the details, so the contents might be way too detailed or too simple if you're already familiar with these topics, and I did not have time to cover all of the contents in the notes.

However, if you're also a non-CS background student / know nothing about machine learning before taking this course, especially if you haven't take any classes related to probability, maybe you can find something useful from my note.

Personally, I think the machine learning part in the note might not be that useful for this course XD, but can help a little bit to tell what everything is going right now. For example, at first I even didn't know what true value $y$ means, where did this $y$ come from? How do we know the true value? What is the relation between $y$ and the input vector $\vec{x}$? I think most of the other students already have the background knowledge like these, or at least have a vague idea about what the grand picture looks like, but if you're like me, maybe you can take a look at my notes.

Lastly, if your knowledge for probability stopped at what we've been taught in high-school, and you're confused about what $i.i.d.$ is or what " $\sim$ some probability" means, I think the `Appendix` part in my note (which is all about probability) covers most of the content that we'll use in this course.
